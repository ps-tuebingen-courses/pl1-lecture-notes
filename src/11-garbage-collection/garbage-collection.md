Let us now consider a more accurate modeling of garbage collection (gc). This time, we will use a mutable store instead of
a functional store, because our purpose is not to explain mutation but to explain gc.


This is the well-known syntax of our language: FAE with boxes.

```scala mdoc
enum Exp:
  case Num(n: Int)
  case Id(name: String)
  case Add(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp)
  case Mul(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp)
  case If0(cond: Exp, thenExp: Exp, elseExp: Exp)
  case Fun(param: String, body: Exp)
  case Ap (funExpr: Exp, argExpr: Exp)

  case NewBox(e: Exp)
  case SetBox(b: Exp, e: Exp)
  case OpenBox(b: Exp)
  case Seq(e1: Exp, e2: Exp)

object Exp:
  implicit def num2exp(n: Int): Exp = Num(n)
  implicit def id2exp(s: String): Exp = Id(s)
  def wth(x: String, xdef: Exp, body: Exp): Exp = Ap(Fun(x, body), xdef)

import Exp._
```


We will equip our values with a mutable flag that is useful for mark-and-sweep garbage collection.
In real systems it is implemented as a bit flag, or, if the so-called "tri-color algorithm" is used, with two bit flags.

```scala mdoc
abstract class Value {
  var marked: Boolean = false
}
```

We will also use a mutable map instead of a map for environments. This is not needed for mark-and-sweep,
but for copying garbage collectors such as Cheney's semi-space garbage collection algorithm.

```scala mdoc
type Env = scala.collection.mutable.Map[String, Value]
case class NumV(n: Int) extends Value
case class ClosureV(f: Fun, env: Env) extends Value
case class AddressV(a: Int) extends Value
```

To be able to experiment with different store and gc designs, we create an interface for stores.
The stack parameter in `malloc` is needed during gc to determine the root nodes from which the algorithms can start.

```scala mdoc
trait Store {
  def malloc(stack: List[Env], v: Value): Int
  def update(index: Int, v: Value): Unit
  def apply(index: Int): Value
}
```

In our interpreter, the stack of environments is only implicitly available on the stack of the meta-language.
To reify the call-stack we need to make it explicit. We do so by constructing the stack explicitly and passing it as parameter.
The first element of the stack is the current environment; the rest is only needed for gc.

```scala mdoc
def eval(e: Exp, stack: List[Env], store: Store): Value = e match {

  case Num(n) => NumV(n)

  case Id(x) => stack.head(x)

  case f@Fun(_, _) => ClosureV(f, stack.head)

  /* With a mutable store, we do not have to thread it according to
   * the order of evaluation any more.
   */

  case If0(cond, thenExp, elseExp)
    => eval(cond, stack, store) match {
         case NumV(0) => eval(thenExp, stack, store)
         case _       => eval(elseExp, stack, store)
       }

  /* The mutable store allows us to take advantage of Scala's
   * evaluation order and perform two pattern matchings
   * simultaneously.
   */

  case Add(l, r)
    => (eval(l, stack, store), eval(r, stack, store)) match {
         case (NumV(v1), NumV(v2)) => NumV(v1 + v2)
         case _ => sys.error("can only add numbers")
       }

  case Mul(l, r)
    => (eval(l, stack, store), eval(r, stack, store)) match {
         case (NumV(v1), NumV(v2)) => NumV(v1 * v2)
         case _ => sys.error("can only multiply numbers")
       }

  /* A new environment should be pushed onto the stack only when
   * binding occurs. Where exactly in BCFAE do bindings happen?
   */

  case Ap(f, a)
    => eval(f, stack, store) match {
         case ClosureV(f, cEnv)
           => eval(
                f.body,
                (cEnv += (f.param -> eval(a, stack, store))) :: stack,
                store
              )
         case _ => sys.error("can only apply functions")
       }

  /* The mutable store allows us to implement Seq-expression
   * in terms of sequencing in Scala itself.
   */

  case Seq(e1, e2)
    => eval(e1, stack, store); eval(e2, stack, store)

  case NewBox(e: Exp)
    => {
         val a = store.malloc(stack, eval(e, stack, store))
         AddressV(a)
       }

  case SetBox(b: Exp, e: Exp)
    => eval(b, stack, store) match {
         case AddressV(a)
           => {
                val ev = eval(e, stack, store)
                store.update(a, ev)
                ev
              }
         case _ => sys.error("can only set boxes")
       }

  case OpenBox(b: Exp)
    => eval(b, stack, store) match {
         case AddressV(a) => store(a)
         case _ => sys.error("can only open boxes")
       }
}
```


Here is one implementation of the Store interface that does not perform gc. It just runs out of memory once the store is full.


```scala mdoc
class NoGCStore(size: Int) extends Store {

  val memory = new Array[Value](size)

  var nextFreeAddr: Int = 0

  def malloc(stack: List[Env], v: Value): Int = {
    val x = nextFreeAddr
    if (x >= size) sys.error("out of memory")
    nextFreeAddr += 1
    update(x, v)
    x
  }

  def update(index: Int, v: Value): Unit = memory.update(index, v)

  def apply(index: Int) = memory(index)
}
```

Here is a mark-and-sweep garbage collector.

```scala mdoc
class MarkAndSweepStore(size: Int) extends Store {

  val memory = new Array[Value](size)

  var free: Int = size

  var nextFreeAddr: Int = 0

  def malloc(stack: List[Env], v: Value): Int = {
    if (free <= 0) gc(stack)
    if (free <= 0) sys.error("out of memory")

    /* Here we find the next available location in memory via a while-
     * loop. In order to avoid maintaining a list of available spaces
     * (because we are lazy), let us assume that no box created in
     * BCFAE can have an address pointing to a null memory cell (which
     * also is the case).
     *
     * If we ensure the invariant that the variable `free` has always
     * the number of free memory space, then the following loop will
     * always halt. The nontermination situation will generate an out-
     * of-memory error and the program will abort. */

    while (memory(nextFreeAddr) != null) {
      nextFreeAddr += 1
      if (nextFreeAddr == size) nextFreeAddr = 0
    }

    free -= 1
    update(nextFreeAddr, v)
    nextFreeAddr
  }

  def update(index: Int, v: Value): Unit = memory.update(index, v)

  def apply(index: Int) = memory(index)

  def allAddrInVal(v: Value): Set[Int] = v match {
    case AddressV(a)      => Set(a)
    case NumV(_)          => Set.empty
    case ClosureV(f, env) => allAddrInEnv(env)
  }

  def allAddrInEnv(env: Env): Set[Int] =
    env.values.map(allAddrInVal _).fold(Set.empty)(_ union _)

  def mark(seed: Set[Int]): Unit = {
    seed.foreach(memory(_).marked = true)
    val newAddresses = seed.flatMap(
                         ad => allAddrInVal(memory(ad))
                       ).filter(!memory(_).marked)
    if(newAddresses != Set.empty) {
      mark(newAddresses)
    }
  }

  /* What graph algorithm underlies the mark step as implemented here?
   * What potential problem could it cause in a "real" interpreter? */

  def sweep(): Unit = {
    memory.indices.foreach(
      index =>   if (memory(index) == null) {
                   /* No work needed on an empty memory cell */
                 }
                 else if (memory(index).marked) {
                   /* Reset `marked` flag for the next gc */
                   memory(index).marked = false
                 }
                 else {
                   free += 1
                   memory(index) = null
                 }
    )
  }

  def gc(stack: List[Env]): Unit = {
    println("\nSTARTING GC\nSTACK = " + stack + "\nSTORE = " + memory)
    mark(stack.map(allAddrInEnv _).fold(Set.empty)(_ union _))
    sweep()
    println("GC COMPLETE\nSTORE = " + memory +
            "\nNUMBER OF FREE SLOTS = " + free)
  }
}
```

```scala mdoc:silent
val test4 = wth("makedata", Fun("x", NewBox(NewBox(NewBox("x")))),
                Seq(Ap("makedata", 1),
                Seq(Ap("makedata", 2),
                Seq(wth("s", Ap("makedata", 3), Ap("makedata", "s")),
                    Ap("makedata", 4)))))
```

```scala mdoc
def runTest4 = eval(test4,
                    List(scala.collection.mutable.Map.empty),
                    new MarkAndSweepStore(5))
```

This model of garbage collection does not illustrate the difficulty of memory management. In most languages, the size of
the allocated memory regions on the heap vary, and hence one needs an algorithm to find a free and large-enough spot on the heap.
There are various algorithms and heuristics (best-fit, worst-fit, first-fit, ...) for that purpose.

There are also various alternative gc designs. Mark-and-sweep is a non-moving algorithm, where reachable heap objects are never moved.
In contrast to that, copying gc algorithms move the reachable objects to a different portion of the heap. One of the oldest algorithms
is the semi-space garbage collector, in particular with the implementation purpose.

Topic for class discussion: What are the pros and cons of moving vs. non-moving gc?

It can be shown empirically that most unreachable objects become unreachable while they are still young. Generational gc algorithms
take this empirical fact into account and divide the objects into generations, whereby the (small) youngest generation of objects
is garbage-collected more frequently.

A typical problem of the simple gc algorithms we discussed is the stop-the-world phenomenon: All execution has to be stopped during
a gc cycle. This issue is addressed by incremental or concurrent garbage collectors. Incremental garbage collectors typically reduce
the total throughput but increase responsiveness and real-time behavior.

A completely different approach to memory management is _reference counting_. In reference counting, each object on the heap
(in our case, each box) maintains a counter which says how many pointers currently point to that object. The counter is adjusted
whenever a pointer variable is assigned to this object (incremented), or moved from this object to another object (decremented).
When the counter is 0, the object can be reclaimed.

The obvious disadvantage of reference counting is that it cannot detect cycles on the heap. Hence reference counting algorithms
must be augmented with some means to detect cycles.

or semi-space?
