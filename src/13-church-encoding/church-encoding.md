# Church Encodings

The content of this chapter is available as a Scala file [here.](./church-encoding.scala)

Now we shrink our language. It does not seem to be big, but here we want to illustrate how powerful our core language,
the lambda calculus, is. Here is a shrinked version of FAE that does not even have numbers anymore. For testing purposes,
we introduce a new expression ``PrintDot`` whose semantics is to print a dot on the screen.

```scala mdoc
enum Exp:
  case Id(name: String)
  case Fun(param: String, body: Exp)
  case Ap(funExpr: Exp, argExpr: Exp)
  case PrintDot()

object Exp:
  implicit def id2exp(s: String): Exp = Id(s)

import Exp._

abstract class Value
type Env = Map[String, Value]
// the only values are closures
case class ClosureV(f: Fun, env: Env) extends Value
```

Notice that the only values in this language are closures. This means that there cannot be the situation anymore that we expect,
say, a number but get in fact a closure. Hence, this language has the fascinating property that  no dynamic type errors can occur.

```scala mdoc
def eval(e: Exp, env: Env): Value = e match {
  // We give the identity function as dummy value for PrintDot
  case PrintDot() => print("."); ClosureV(Fun("x", "x"), Map.empty)
  case Id(x) => env(x)
  case f@Fun(param, body) => ClosureV(f, env)
  case Ap(f, a) => eval(f, env) match {
    case ClosureV(f, closureEnv) => eval(f.body, closureEnv + (f.param -> eval(a, env)))
  }
}
```

Now we want to illustrate that we can, in principle, bootstrap a full programming language from this small core.
To do so, we use the technique of Church encoding. This means that each datum is represented by its own fold function.

## Church Encoding of Booleans

Let's start with booleans and boolean arithmetic.

```scala mdoc:silent
val f = Fun("t", Fun("f", "f"))  // false
val t = Fun("t", Fun("f", "t"))  // true
val and = Fun("a", Fun("b", Ap(Ap("a", "b"), "a")))
val or = Fun("a", Fun("b", Ap(Ap("a", "a"), "b")))
val not = Fun("a", Fun("t", Fun("f", Ap(Ap("a", "f"), "t"))))
```

We can now write our own control structures, such as ``if/then/else``

```scala mdoc:silent
val ifthenelse = Fun("cond", Fun("t", Fun("f", Ap(Ap("cond", "t"), "f"))))
```

## Church Encoding of Numbers

Let's now consider Numbers. We encode them as Peano numbers. These encodings of numbers are often called _Church numbers_.

```scala mdoc:silent
val zero = Fun("s", Fun("z", "z"))
val succ = Fun("n", Fun("s", Fun("z", Ap("s", Ap(Ap("n", "s"), "z")))))
val one = Ap(succ, zero)
val two = Ap(succ, one)
val three = Ap(succ, two)
val add  = Fun("a", Fun("b", Fun("s", Fun("z", Ap(Ap("a", "s"), Ap(Ap("b", "s"), "z"))))))
val mult = Fun("a", Fun("b", Fun("s", Fun("z", Ap(Ap("a", Ap("b", "s")), "z")))))
val exp  = Fun("a", Fun("b", Ap(Ap("b", Ap(mult, "a")), one)))
val iszero = Fun("a", Ap(Ap("a", Fun("x", f)), t))
```

The predecessor function is more complicated (why?). We do not show it here.
For testing, here is a function that prints a unary representation of a number.

```scala mdoc:silent
val printnum = Fun("a", Ap(Ap("a", Fun("x", PrintDot())), f))
```

## Church encoding of lists

Again straightforward, except "tail", which we do not show here. It needs the same kind of trick (called "pairing trick")
as the predecessor function.

```scala mdoc:silent
val emptylist = Fun("c", Fun("e", "e"))
val cons = Fun("h", Fun("r", Fun("c", Fun("e", Ap(Ap("c", "h"), Ap(Ap("r", "c"), "e"))))))
val head = Fun("l", Ap(Ap("l", Fun("h", Fun("t", "h"))), f))
```

For instance, we can multiply all numbers in a list

```scala mdoc:silent
val multlist = Fun("l", Ap(Ap("l", mult), one))
```

Here is the list 3, 2, 3:

```scala mdoc:silent
val list323 = Ap(Ap(cons, three), Ap(Ap(cons, two), Ap(Ap(cons, three), emptylist)))

```

```scala mdoc:silent
val test = Ap(printnum, Ap(multlist, list323))
```

Calling `exec` should yield 18 dots before the dummy result

```scala mdoc
val exec = eval(test, Map.empty)
```

Topic for class discussion: Can we do these encodings directly in Scala or Haskell?
